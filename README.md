Welcome to my Profile. This is an overview of all the work I did and I'm planning to do.

## ðŸ”­ About Me
Hi! Iâ€™m Udbhav Tripathi and I work on Generative AI. I am particularly interested in applications of Computer vision, RL, NLP and Time series analysis. I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, and I have worked on developing algorithms and models for various applications. I am passionate about exploring the potential of these technologies and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of AI. Currently I am working as a Data Scientist at [Unnati Agri](https://unnatiagri.com/)

1. [Transfer learning for Malaria detection](https://github.com/udbhavtripathi/Transfer-Learning-for-Malaria-Detection): 
The project demonstrates using transfer learning with MobileNetV2 to enhance malaria detection accuracy in medical images with limited training data.[[Blog]](https://medium.com/@udbhav9696/transfer-learning-for-malaria-detection-345c3dd8fac0)



2. [Physics-integrated deep learning for uncertainty quantification and reliability estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems](https://github.com/udbhavtripathi/Physics-integrated-Variational-Auto-Encoder-PVAE-/tree/main): In this Project I have developed a Physics Integrated Variational Auto Encoder to model nonlinear and Stochastic dynamical system. The main idea to use and ODE solver in the decoder which will solve partial linear system additively augmented with output of MLP which will take care of remaining physics. Based on the result obtained it can be said that this model is suitable for system with parametric uncertaininty and modelling discrepencies and especially is the cases where large number of measurement samples are required.
