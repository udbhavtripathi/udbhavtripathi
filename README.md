## ðŸ”­ About Me
Hi! Iâ€™m Udbhav Tripathi and I work on Generative AI. I am particularly interested in applications of Computer vision, RL, NLP and Time series analysis. I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics, and computer science, and I have worked on developing algorithms and models for various applications. I am passionate about exploring the potential of these technologies and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the field of AI. Currently I am working as a Data Scientist at [Unnati Agri](https://unnatiagri.com/)
